-- file-store schema. Create-only and idempotent: Open() executes this whole
-- file on every boot. A new column goes in ensureColumns in store.go, never in
-- an edit to a CREATE TABLE below — an edited CREATE TABLE is a no-op against a
-- database that already exists.

-- A file is one upload: these bytes, under this name, put here by this service
-- for this thing of its own. The bytes are not in this table. They are on disk,
-- named by their SHA-256, so the same bytes uploaded twice are stored once and
-- two rows point at them. A row is what has an owner and a lifetime; a blob
-- lives exactly as long as some row, deleted or not, still names it.
--
-- owner_service and owner_ref are not foreign keys: the thing a file is
-- attached to belongs to another database. They say who put the file here and
-- for what ("kanban-store", a card id), which is what lets that service list
-- its own files and what a retention sweep will ask.
